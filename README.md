These are my personal scripts to make doing a clean installation of Windows easier. It keeps my work environment in one place that is easy to keep track of and manage. I kept it public as it may be useful to other people.

## How to use these scripts:
First:
Attempt running the script.
If it does not run, try:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser 

Second:
Execute InstallSoftware.ps1 script.

Third:
Install software not available in chocolatey, such as vcpkg. The InstallSoftware.ps1 in the testing repo should automatically prompt you to install VCPKG to "~/Documents", but I have not tested it. 

Fourth:
Install all other dependencies, such as Win SDK using Visual Studio Installer.

Fifth:
Set VCPKG_ROOT environment variable. Ensure it's added to path. Make sure CMAKE installer correctly added CMAKE to path.
